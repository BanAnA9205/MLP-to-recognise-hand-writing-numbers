I send my sincere gratitude to Dariel Dato-on for having provided me the dataset to train my model.

========================

A little story about me:

I stumbled upon the problem of training a machine to recognise hand-written numbers in 2019 when I was in 9th grade. 

Obviously I couldn't solve it since I had no knowledge on what these things were (just documents on basic data structures alone were considered rare back then in my hometown).

I couldn't help but feel fascinating about how an algorithm can create the so-called "computer vision", but at the same time frustrated because there was nothing I can do.

Five years later, I'm studying CS and do have enough knowledge to finally make one myself now, so this can be seen as a tribute to my past self.

The model may just be another drop in the ocean. It may not be a good one, but I'm content with it.
